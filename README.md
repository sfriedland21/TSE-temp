## CS50 Winter 2020, Tiny Search Engine

TSE is a modular search engine comprised of a (Crawler)[crawler/README.md], (Indexer)[indexer/README.md],
and (Querier)[querier/README.md] that interact with a finite domain of webpages internal to a Dartmouth CS department server. 
See each component's README for more information. 

I contributed the code in the `common`, `crawler`, `indexer`, and `querier` directories and in a (TSE-datastructures-temp)[https://github.com/sfriedland21/TSE-datastructures-temp], 
wrote separate implementations of the counterset (counters), set, and hashtable datastructures in `libcs50`.

*Run on a Linux system or server.*

To build, run `make`.

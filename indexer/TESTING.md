### Testing
Note that TESTING.md is different from the ‘Testing plan’, which is a short high-level description written before you code. TESTING.md contains (or refers to) results from the tests. It may refer to other files that contain input to or output from your test runs, or scripts to run the tests; they need not be copied into this file. (Indeed, your file will be much more readable if you don’t fill it with long scripts or output!)
